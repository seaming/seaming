<h1>Celestial mechalculator</h1>

<p>
  This page performs various calculations for simple Keplerian orbits.
  Units can be changed by simply clicking on them; this will cycle through the available units.
</p>

<p>
  Imprecise and ambiguous units are defined as follows.

  <dt>Day</dt><dd>Exactly 86,400 seconds (exactly 24 hours).</dd>
  <dt>Year</dt><dd>Exactly 31,557,600 seconds (exactly 365.25 days).</dd>
  <dt>Solar radius</dt><dd>The IAU nominal solar radius is used, defined as exactly 695,700 km.</dd>

<p>
  For the purposes of calculations for secondary bodies, the primaries are treated as a single body
  with a total mass equal to the sum of the masses entered.

  <dt>Mass<br>Luminosity</dt><dd>
    <p>
      The luminosity of a star is the power radiated by the star as electromagnetic radiation,
      and as such has the SI unit of watts (W, J s<sup>-1</sup>). Mass and luminosity are related
      by the mass&ndash;luminosity relationship:
    </p>
    <span class="equation">
      <div class="fraction"><span>L</span><span>L<sub>⊙</sub></span></div>
      <span class="operator">=</span>
      <span class="left-paren"></span>
      <div class="fraction"><span>M</span><span>M<sub>⊙</sub></span></div>
      <span class="right-paren"><sup class="symbol">a</sup></span>
    </span>
    <p>
      The exponent <span class="symbol">a</span> varies with the mass and can be determined empirically.
      This calculator uses the values of <span class="symbol">a</span> given by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass–luminosity_relation">Wikipedia</a>; the values it finds
      are approximate only.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Radius<br>Temperature</dt><dd>
    <p>The stellar radius and temperature are related to its luminosity by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:</p>
    <span class="equation">
      <span>L</span>
      <span class="operator">=</span>
      <span>4&ThinSpace;&pi;&ThinSpace;R<sup>2</sup></span>
      <span>&sigma;&ThinSpace;T<sup>4</sup></span>
    </span>
    <p>
      This gives the total power emitted by a perfect blackbody radiator. Real stars have deviations from
      the ideal blackbody spectrum due to absorption of certain wavelengths by chemical species in the
      star's atmosphere. For example, helium was first detected by its absorption lines in the spectrum of
      the Sun.

    <p>
      This calculator uses the Morgan&ndash;Keenan (MK) classification system to
      assign classes to stars. In the MK system, each star is assigned a spectral class (indicating its
      temperature) and a luminosity class (indicating its size).
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectral class uses the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M in order from hottest to coldest and
      a number from 0 to 9 with 0 being the hottest and 9 the coolest. The luminosity class is a Roman
      numeral from 0 to VII, corresponding to certain types of star of different sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stars can be plotted on a Hertzsprung&ndash;Russell (HR) diagram, a chart with luminosity and
      temperature as its axes. This reveals the different types of stars and their development
      throughout their lifetime can be plotted on the diagram. A live HR diagram showing the stars
      you have defined below is plotted to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculator does not find the luminosity class due to difficulties in defining ranges of
      parameters that give appropriate results. It is recommended that you identify the luminosity
      class from the positions of your stars on the diagram.
