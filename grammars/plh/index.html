      <h1>Proto-Lahiri language</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri is the linguistic reconstruction of the most recent common ancestor of the Lahiri languages, a
        family of languages distributed across Lahan and parts of Puzimm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most estimates of Proto-Lahiri's age have it spoken as a single language around 4000 BCE, although, due to the
        uncertainty of the comparative method, this date varies between estimates by more than a thousand years. Due to
        the presence of various archaeological sites around Puzimm and Proto-Lahiri's commonly-accepted relation to the
        neighbouring Adzo-Neviric languages in north and eastern Baredina, the original homeland of Proto-Lahiri's
        speakers is believed to have been somewhere in Puzimm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Genetic evidence suggests Proto-Lahiri speakers migrated across the Lahan Sea somewhere between 4000 and 3500
        BCE, and successive migrations split the language and people into various groups. Following various gradual
        shifts in phonology and morphology, the languages of these groups diverged and the Proto-Lahiri language
        transformed into ancient Lahiri languages, and, following further development, the modern Lahiri language
        family.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        The Proto-Lahiri speakers were a semi-nomadic people, with the reconstructed lexicon suggesting a lifestyle
        heavily dependent upon the sea. Limited agricultural terms and archaeological sites suggest the Proto-Lahiri
        speakers were seasonally dependent upon agriculture, a period during which they would become sedentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri's large vocabulary around storytelling and genealogy suggests a strong oral tradition; this is
        reflected in some branches of the family which also feature strong oral histories and a collective body of myth
        shared between many languages and ethnic groups.

      <h3>Stress</h3>

      <p>
        Stress in Proto-Lahiri is contrastive and indicated with an acute accent. Stress placement on monosyllables is
        trivial and so is not indicated. As derivational and inflectional morphemes rarely take stress, polysyllabic
        words where the stem is monosyllabic may be found to have no stress marking - these can be assumed to be
        stressed on the stem.

      <h2>Morphology</h2>
      <h3>Nouns and noun phrases</h3>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri classifies all nouns by three categories: register, animacy, and number class. All nouns have an
        inherent value for each of these categories which affects nominal morphology, verbal agreement, and clause
        structure, among other things. Various methods exist to change a noun's value for each of these categories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Register corresponds roughly with formality or politeness. Three registers exist: neutral, polite, and vulgar.
        The register used for a given noun reflects the speaker's attitude towards the noun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri has a complex animacy system, centered around a large animacy hierarchy, upon which all nouns are
        located. Nouns are located fairly predictably on the hierarchy based on their semantics, however
        register-changing alternations may cause nouns to move up or down the hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The animacy hierarchy features prominently in Proto-Lahiri's syntax and affects how verbs assign thematic roles
        to their arguments. The hierarchy is given, in order, below. Levels on the hierarchy are referred to by their
        number with <sc>g-</sc> prefixed, e.g. <sc>g1</sc>.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="list-exclude">Second person personal pronouns</li>
        <li class="list-exclude">First person personal pronouns</li>
        <li class="list-exclude space">Third person personal pronouns</li>
        <li>Religious (gods; priests; other sacred or divine nouns)</li>
        <li>Adult sentient beings</li>
        <li>Flying animals (birds; bats; excludes bugs which occur lower)</li>
        <li>Large animals (including flightless birds)</li>
        <li>Medium animals (including young sentient beings such as children)</li>
        <li>Small animals</li>
        <li>Moderate (fire; liquids; body parts)</li>
        <li>Large plants</li>
        <li>Small plants</li>
        <li>Constructed inanimates (structures; tools)</li>
        <li>Bugs (most small invertebrates)</li>
        <li>Terrain (rocks; landscape features)</li>
        <li>Uncouth (parasites; disease; natural disasters)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Personal pronouns are not typically placed on the hierarchy but have a position and order in it and behave
        similarly to other nouns with respect to it, hence are included here for clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Number class determines what form of number marking a noun may take. Three number classes exist: count,
        non-count, and mass. Count nouns take full number marking, non-count nouns take no marking whatsoever, and mass
        nouns indicate number through classifiers. Mass nouns form a semantic class, whereas assignment to count or
        non-count is arbitrary.
      </p>

      <h4>Number</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri nouns mark for three numbers: singular, paucal, and plural. The paucal is used for "a few" of a
        noun, with what counts as "a few" being largely determined by context and the noun in question.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number markers are a set of prefixes, exhibiting significant variation based on the animacy of the noun
        being marked.

      <h4>Possession</h4>

      <p>
        Possession is head-marked, being indicated on the possessed noun with one of a set of affixes that agrees with
        the person, number, and animacy of the possessor. The possessor follows the possessed noun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Possessive inflection occurs after number inflection, so possessive morphemes occur externally to number
        morphemes.

      <h4>Pronouns</h4>
      <h5>Personal pronouns</h5>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri has a large collection of personal pronouns, distinguishing four persons, twelve noun classes in
        the third person, and two numbers, resulting in 30 personal pronouns in total. In addition, the three registers
        are distinguished on all second and third person pronouns by means of regular derivation.

        The forms of the interrogatives are given here primarily for reference as they form the basis of the indefinite
        pronoun series. Their role in forming questions will be discussed later, in <a href="#questions"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distributional schema of the functions of the indefinite pronouns is given below.

      <p>
        As can be seen in the map there are four series of indefinite pronouns, each marked with different prefixes.
        Each of these series serve different purposes, shown in the map, which will now be elaborated on.
      </p>

      <p>
        As can be seen in the schema, the <or>i-</or>series occurs as an antecedent for specific referents, known or
        unknown to the speaker. These usages are illustrated in <ref>i-series</ref>.

        The <or>kee.én-</or>series overlaps with the <or>i-</or>series in specific unknown use cases. In these cases,
        use of the <or>kee.én-</or>series generally indicates the antecedent of the indefinite pronoun is less animate
        or volitional in the phrase.

        The <or>kee.én-</or>series has the broadest set of use cases: alongside specific unknown use cases where it

      <h3>Verbs and verb phrases</h3>

      <h4>Evidentiality</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri verbs mark for three evidential categories. These categories are marked with simple prefixes. As
        with nominal marking, <or>aa</or> is inserted between the prefix and the verb stem where it would create an
        illegal syllable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The direct evidential is used for events experienced directly, such as by sight or touch. This includes
        "direct" sensory experience such as hearing something that can also be seen, but does not include "indirect"
        sensory experience such as hearing something that is not within the speaker's line of sight. It is marked with
        the prefix <or>s-</or>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The indirect evidential is used for events experienced indirectly. This includes indirect sensory experience
        such as hearing things out of line of sight, and other indirect knowledge such as through hearsay. It is marked
        with the prefix <or>n-</or>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ref>direct minimal</ref> and <ref>indirect minimal</ref> form a minimal pair, illustrating the distinction
        between the direct and indirect evidentials.

      <h4>Moods</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri distinguishes three moods in verbal marking: realis, which is the default unmarked form of a verb;
        irrealis, used for a wide variety of situations that are not or have yet to be realised; and dubitative, a
        subtype of irrealis which indicates uncertainty or doubt as to whether an event will occur.
      </p>

      <p>
        The realis is the basic form of any verb stem, being unmarked and relatively semantically neutral. It is used
        for situations that either have already happened, are happening, or are guaranteed to happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The irrealis form is used for events are not real, whether they are hypothetical or future events or if the
        speaker is unsure. Situations where the irrealis mood might be used include in the protasis of conditionals,
        certain modal expressions, future events which may not happen, and inferential statements for which the speaker
        has no evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The irrealis is marked with a nasal infix: <or>n</or> is inserted after the last vowel in the word, which is
        then copied to after the infix after being put through a raising process, which will be described below.
      </p>

        </gloss>
        <trans>He might have gone home.</trans>
      </translation>

      <p>
        In raising, vowels shift upwards, becoming the next higher vowel in the case of /ä ə/, which become /ə ɨ/
        respectively, or cracking into /jə/ in the case of /ɨ/. Vowel phonation is preserved in this process, so /ä ä̰/
        become /ə ə̰/ respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dubitative form, a subtype of the irrealis, is used for events that are not real and which the speaker is
        uncertain or doubts will become real, and can be used wherever the irrealis is. It is marked by reduplicating
        the first vowel in the word to the start of the word, between the stem and the evidential prefix, raising
        the first vowel in the stem (i.e. the original vowel that was reduplicated), and suffixing <or>-s</or>,
        inserting <or>aa</or> if this would violate the word's phonotactics.
      </p>

      <p>
        On words that begin in vowels, the initial reduplication is not carried out, however the first vowel is still
        raised in place.

      <h4>Modals</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri's modals makes their primary distinction in modal base, leaving modal force lexically
        unspecified. There are three modal particles which situate before the verb.
      </p>

      <p>
        The modal particle <or>ki</or> has its modal base in capability - the a priori physical or mental ability of
        the subject. This is to be distinguished from the epistemic modal <or>le</or> which can also have capabilitive
        meaning but differs in the origin of capability, with the epistemic specifying ability from knowledge and the
        capabilitive <or>ki</or> specifying inherent ability. For this reason, <or>ki</or> is rarely used with human or
        sentient subjects as human ability is considered to derive from knowledge rather than inherent ability or
        instinct, as with an animal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The capabilitive modal <or>ki</or> requires the main verb to be marked for the inferential evidential; other
        evidential markings are considered ungrammatical.
      </p>

          <trans>This axe must be able to cut through dense forest.</trans>
        </translation>
      </transgroup>

      <p>
        As Proto-Lahiri's modals do not specify modal force, <ref>irrealis capabilitive modal</ref> permits alternate
        translations with varying modal force.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note the variation in meaning based off of mood marking on the verb in <ref>capabilitive mood change</ref>. In
        the realis, as the situation is real, only one interpretation is valid, in which the axe is definitely able to
        cut through dense forest. However, in the irrealis, as the situation becomes hypothetical, two interpretations
        become valid because of the unspecified modal force.
      </p>

      <p>
        <or>ki</or> also distinguishes itself from <or>le</or> in permitting circumstantial readings, where <or>le</or>
        does not. <or>ki</or> allows human or sentient subjects in circumstantial readings, and use of a human or
        sentient subject with <or>ki</or> tends to cause a circumstantial interpretation.

      <p>
        The modal <or>ka</or> expresses deontic modality - what could or must be according to some set of rules or
        beliefs. As with the other modals, the modal force is unspecified. <or>ka</or> does not enforce any evidential
        or modal requirements upon the marking of the verb.

      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <h3>Primary word order</h3>

      <p>
        Proto-Lahiri displays a primary <kbd>SVO</kbd> word order, as can be seen in <ref>svo order</ref>. This is
        complicated, however, as the order of arguments is determined by their animacy rather than their theta roles,
        with the core argument higher on the animacy hierarchy occurring before the verb. This results in <kbd>OVS</kbd>
        word order in clauses with an agent of lower animacy than the patient. Such cases are marked with the inverse
        marker, which indicates the lower animacy argument is the agent; this can be seen in <ref>ovs order</ref>.

        So called 'clausal modifiers' precede the verb, following the subject. This slot contains various modifiers
        such as negative and modal particles and the passive marker. This slot can contain multiple markers, as in
        negation alongside a modal, however this is dispreferred and any given category in this slot can be marked

        One notable feature of Proto-Lahiri's syntax is the dispreference of iteration on adjunct nodes. It is near
        impossible, for instance, for multiple locative obliques to occur in the same clause. This is also reflected in
        the language's lack of root trivalent verbs, with notions such as giving being expressed with a coordinate
        clause or benefactive oblique.

      <p>
        The analysis of the benefactor of the giving in <ref>give construction example</ref> as a benefactive oblique
        and not as a core argument is motivated primarily by its marking as a benefactive, identically to the marking
        of benefactive obliques in other, prototypically bivalent constructions. In addition, the clause allows
        omission of the oblique without change in the roles of the core arguments or the clause's overall
        grammaticality.
