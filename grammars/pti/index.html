      <h4>Coarticulation series</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic stop and nasal consonants occur at three primary places of articulation, in plain forms and with
        two coarticulations. These coarticulation series are summarised in the table below.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should be noted that the palatal forms of the velar consonants are actually palatal consonants /c ɟ ɲ/.
        Despite this, they are romanised as <or>kʲ gʲ ŋʲ</or>. All other consonants are romanised as their IPA.

      <p>
        The table excludes those stops which are part of the coarticulation series, as detailed in the previous

        which is romanised as <or>y</or>.

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic has a vertical vowel inventory, with only three phonemic vowel qualities. There is however
        extensive allophony, with each vowel phoneme having two allophones that it assimilates to when following a
        coarticulated consonant. The phonemic vowels and their allophones are presented in the table to the right.
      </p>

      <p>
        The palatal allophones occur when the vowel follows a palatalised consonant or /j/. Similarly, the rounded
        allophones occur when the vowel follows a rounded consonant or /w/.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vowel phonemes are romanised as <or>i e a</or> /ɨ ɘ ɐ/ and allophonic alternations are not indicated.
      </p>

      <h4>Syllabic consonants</h4>

      <p>
        Nasal consonants /m n ŋ/ can be syllabified and act as syllable nuclei. The same is not true of their
        coarticulated forms (/mʲ nʲ nʷ/ etc.), which, if syllabified, will simply result in epenthesis of a vowel
        following the nasal, /ɨ/ for palatal nasals and /ɘ/ for rounded nasals.
      </p>

      <div class="center">
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>consonantal</th>
              <td>m</td>
              <td>mʲ</td>
              <td>n</td>
              <td>nʲ</td>
              <td>nʷ</td>
              <td>ŋ</td>
              <td>ŋʲ</td>
              <td>ŋʷ</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>syllabic</th>
              <td>m̩</td>
              <td>mɨ</td>
              <td>n̩</td>
              <td>nɨ</td>
              <td>nɘ</td>
              <td>ŋ̩</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        The syllabic nasals are romanised identically to non-syllabic nasals and their syllabification must be inferred
        from syllable structure.
      </p>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic's two glide consonants (/j/ and /w/) interact with vowels to produce additional allophones when
        immediately following a consonant. This results in mutation of the vowel and the glide being realised as a
        syllabified version of the vowel. This is presented in the table to the right.
      </p>

      <h3>Syllable structure</h3>

      <div class="indent">
        <kbd>({C, SF}) (L<sub>1</sub>) V (L<sub>2</sub>) (C)</kbd>
      </div>

      <p>
        Elements enclosed in braces and comma-separated represent an "either-or" selection, e.g. <kbd>{C, SF}</kbd>
        means either any consonant (<kbd>C</kbd>) or a stop followed by a fricative (<kbd>SF</kbd>).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><kbd>S</kbd> is a stop, i.e. one of /p t k b d g/ including all variant coarticulations</li>
        <li><kbd>F</kbd> is a fricative, i.e. either /s/ or /z/</li>
        <li><kbd>L</kbd> is a liquid, i.e. one of /l r j w/</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Voicing contrasts are prohibited in <kbd>SF(L)</kbd> onsets, with the stop assimilating in voicing with the
        fricative.
      </p>

      <p>
        <kbd>L<sub>1</sub></kbd> and <kbd>L<sub>2</sub></kbd> are mutually exclusive, i.e. a liquid cannot occur in
        both the onset and coda.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
      Any diphthongs are prohibited; if two vowels come into contact, an intervening glottal stop is inserted.
    </p> -->

      <h3>Stress</h3>

      <p>
        Stress is not contrastive and can be regularly determined from syllable weights. Stress will fall on the
        heavier of either the ultimate or penultimate syllable if the antepenultimate syllable is light, otherwise
        falling on the antepenultimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Syllable weights are determined as follows.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>All syllables start with a weight of 0.</li>
        <li>Syllables with a coda are given +1 to their weight.</li>
        <li>Syllables with a complex onset are given +1 to their weight.</li>
        <li>Syllables with a glide in the onset are given -1 to their weight.</li>
        <li>Syllables with a glide in the coda are given +1 to their weight.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Syllable reduction</h4>

      <p>
        Syllable reduction is a common morphological process where syllables are altered to reduce their weight. The
        exact steps of reduction may differ in certain circumstances, so the most common reduction method is given
        here. Where a different reduction method is used, it will be described and syllable reduction can otherwise be
        assumed to follow these steps.

          <kbd>Nʷ → w</kbd>) or dropped.<br>
          If the final consonant is a glide it undergoes metathesis with the vowel and the consonant will frequently
          reduce to ʔ or have its coarticulations removed (reduction to CLV).

        <div class="col-1">CLVC</div>

      <h2>Morphology</h2>
      <h3>Verbs and verb phrases</h3>
      <h4>Verb classes</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic verbs are broadly divided into six classes, with class assignment being primarily semantic. These
        classes conflate with transitivity, with each class having a default transitivity and productive
        morphosyntactic valency-changing operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The classes are given below.

      <div class="row-2 descriptor-list">
        <div class="col-2 sc">motion</div>
        <div class="col-10">
          These verbs describe motion from one position or point to another (e.g. stand up, arrive, leave) are by
          default intransitive.
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 sc">emotion</div>
        <div class="col-10">
          These verbs describe mental states (e.g. think, be angry, concentrate) and are by default intransitive.
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 sc">transfer</div>
        <div class="col-10">
          These verbs are those which involve transfer of ownership (e.g. give, take, buy, sell, provide) or
          reciprocal motion (e.g. swap, spin). These verbs are by default transitive.
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 sc">creation</div>
        <div class="col-10">
          These verbs describe actions of creation (e.g. build, pile up, connect, shape) and are by default
          transitive. This class also contains certain verbs wherein the object changes state such as clean or
          causative open.
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 sc">state</div>
        <div class="col-10">
          These verbs describe states of being, including predicative adjectives, and are by default intransitive.

        Proto-Tiengic has a number of tense and aspect categories, with the two categories being conflated in some
        inflections. While tense and aspect are primarily indicated with fusional affixes, mood categories are always
        distinct, being indicated primarily with auxiliaries following the verb.
      </p>

      <p>
        While all verb classes share a past and non-past distinction, not all classes distinguish the same set of
        aspects. The table to the side shows the sets of aspects each class distinguishes and the listing below
        provides definitions for each of the aspectual abbreviations.

      <h4>Valency-changing operations on <span class="sc">motion</span> verbs</h4>

      <p>
        Verbs in the <span class="sc">motion</span> class have a large set of valency-increasing auxiliaries that
        introduce a target of motion. The semantic nature of the introduced argument depends on the combination of the
        verb and the auxiliary used.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain auxiliaries require that the introduced argument is in the construct state.
      </p>

      <div class="center descendant-suggestion">
        <p>
          As these auxiliaries precede the verb, they will immediately follow the introduced argument, lending
          themselves to reinterpretation as locative postclitics in daughters.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <or>dʲa</or> indicates the direction or final destination of motion. The introduced argument is in the
        construct state.
      </p>

      <h4>Other valency-changing operations</h4>

      <p>
        One of Proto-Tiengic's most widely used valency-changing devices is the applicative suffix <or>-pʷer</or> which
        introduces an argument. The role of the argument depends on the verb in question, but is usually the semantic
        patient.
      </p>

        <trans>example</trans>
      </translation>

      <p>
        On <span class="sc">motion</span> verbs, the suffix usually takes a causative meaning. When used on certain
        verbs it can cause the verb class to change, as seen in <ref>pre-causative motion</ref> and <ref>post-causative
          creation</ref> wherein the verb 'to open' shifts to the <span class="sc">creation</span> class when the
        applicative is used.

      <h3>Nouns and noun phrases</h3>

      <h4>Number</h4>

      <p>
        Nouns mark for two numbers, plural and collective plural, with unmarked nouns being in the singular.
      </p>

      <p>
        The plural is marked by reduplicating the final syllable and reducing it (see <a href="#syllable_reduction">syllable
          reduction</a>). The collective plural is marked with a postposition, <or>ge</or>. The plural and collective
        plural are not mutually exclusive, as can be seen in <ref>pl_and_col</ref>.

        Note that 'hands' in <ref>hands-1</ref> and <ref>hands-2</ref> means hands in a flat, palms up position.
      </p>

      <h4>Possession</h4>

      <p>
        Rather than marking for a possessive, Proto-Tiengic take marking if they are possessed, the so-called construct
        state. This marking is also used in certain syntactic situations where it indicates that the noun has certain
        syntactic dependents. The marking agrees with the person of the dependent introduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is marked with an infix, reduplicating the nucleus of the final syllable before the coda with an infixed
        consonant.
      </p>

      <p>
        As can be seen above, the <or>kʲ</or> in the third person will lose its coarticulation if it precedes another
        coarticulated consonant and will occasionally dissimilate in voicing with the coda consonant it is inserted
        before.
      </p>

      <p>
        These infixes do not affect the syllable reduplicated in plural marking.

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic distinguishes only the first and second persons in personal pronouns, with pronouns inflecting as
        nouns do. These pronouns are presented in the table to the right.
      </p>

      <p>
        In lieu of third person personal pronouns, Proto-Tiengic has a large, closed set of basic nouns that serve as
        prototypes of various categories and are used as anaphora for other noun phrases in their category. For the
        purposes of analysis, these classifier pronouns are considered to be separate from but homophonous with their
        respective nouns (and in some cases the classifier pronouns are reduced versions of the normal noun).
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in <ref>classifier pronoun example</ref>, <or>yedi</or> is used as anaphor for a human third
        person referent and <or>nagʷ</or> for a long, thin, flat third person referent, here a knife blade. In casual
        speech <or>ŋeʔ</or> 'knife' would be elided as it is the purpose of the anaphor and context to disambiguate.

      <h4>Interrogative and indefinite pronouns</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic has a single series of interrogative pronouns and three series of indefinite pronouns, fulfulling
        different functions. The indefinite pronoun series are derived from the interrogative pronoun series. These
        series distinguish 8 ontological categories: person, thing, place, direction, kind, time, amount, and reason.

      </div>

      <p>
        From the schema presented above, it can be seen that the <or>ki</or>-series is used for indefinites both known
        and unknown to the speaker, as in <ref>specific known</ref> and <ref>specific unknown</ref>, for
        non-specific referents in irrealis clauses, as in <ref>nonspecific irrealis</ref>, and in polar questions, as

      <p>
        The <or>bʷay</or>-series is also used for non-specific referents in irrealis clauses, overlapping in usage with
        the <or>ki</or>-series - in these situations, usage of the <or>bʷay</or>-series tends to be more poetic or
        formal. It is also used in the protasis of conditional clauses, as in <ref>conditional protasis</ref>, and as
        the standard of comparison in comparative
        clauses, as in <ref>comparative standard</ref>.

        The <or>bʷay</or>-series is also used in indirect negation, seen in <ref>indirect negation</ref>, where it

      <h2>Syntax</h2>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic is a strongly head-final language, with an SOV primary word order and adjectives preceding nouns.
      </p>

      <h3>Adjectives and adverbs</h3>

      <p>
        Adjectives precede the nouns they modify and multiple adjectives may be used to modify a single noun.
        Adjectives are universally single words (including associated morphology) and multiple-word phrases as nominal
        modifiers are not permitted (excepting <a href="#relative_clauses">relative clauses</a>).

      <p>
        Similarly, verbs permit simple adverbs that precede them.
      </p>

        <trans>He fell from a height.</trans>
      </translation>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic also permits more complex adverbial phrases, with a large set of adverbialisers that follow the
        introduced adverbial constituent and indicate the way it modifies the verb.
      </p>

      <p>
        A list of adverbialisers is given in the appendices.
      </p>

      <h3>Simple clauses</h3>

          <figcaption>The structure of simple clauses.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        A syntax tree describing the structure of simple clauses in Proto-Tiengic is given to the right. Notable in
        this tree is the element <kbd>Pol</kbd>, the polarity marker. This is a marker that occupies the specifier
        position of the verb phrase and marks the polarity of the clause. In affirmative clauses it has no phonological
        realisation. This element will be described in greater detail below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most simple clauses in Proto-Tiengic consist of a verbal predicate and one or two noun phrases as
        arguments. <ref>simple intransitive</ref> illustrates the use of a single argument with an intransitive verb to
        form a simple intransitive clause. Similarly, <ref>simple transitive</ref> illustrates a simple transitive
        clause.

      </translation>

      <h4>Polarity marking</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic clauses mark for polarity using the <kbd>Pol</kbd> constituent in the clause structure. The slot
        is occupied by a single particle that indicates the clause's polarity. As the polarity marker occupies the
        specifier position of the verb phrase it can only occur once per clause and has no dependents.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common form of the polarity marker is the affirmative (<span class="sc">aff</span>) which has no overt
        phonetic realisation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In negative polarity clauses the polarity marker has the form <or>kʷi</or>.
      </p>

      <translation>
        <gloss>

      <h3>Syntactic valency alternations</h3>

      <p>
        Alongside morphological valency-changing operations, Proto-Tiengic's verb classes have a number of syntactic
        methods for changing their valency.
      </p>

      <h3>Auxiliary verb constructions</h3>

      <div class="right-aside">
        <figure>
          <embed src="avc.svg" width="230px">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic has a large collection of auxiliary verbs that typically indicate modality or aspect (alongside
        aspectual marking on the lexical verb). Auxiliaries form an auxiliary phrase with the lexical verb, which they
        become the head of, causing the lexical verb to shift to before the object as it becomes an adjunct of the
        auxiliary phrase. TAM markers on the lexical verb are additionally transferred to the auxiliary.
      </p>

        clauses or in a response to a question.

      <h3>Polar questions</h3>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic forms polar questions using a particle, <or>za</or>, at the end of the corresponding declarative
        clause.
      </p>

      <div class="right-aside">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic forms content questions using its interrogative pronoun series. Interrogative pronouns can
        function as nouns or as adjectives modifying classifier pronouns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Introduction of an interrogative pronoun as an argument, although a valency-increasing operation, requires no
        overt valency-changing markers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic exhibits wh-fronting and pied-piping with interrogative pronouns, with the phrase that the
        interrogative is a part of being moved to the front of the clause.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wh-fronting results in transferral of the <kbd>VP</kbd> to a complement phrase (<kbd>CP</kbd>) and raising of
        the <kbd>Pol</kbd> constituent to the head of the complement phrase. This raising can also be seen in
        subordination and construction of relative clauses.

      <h4>Long-distance content questions</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic allows double extraction of an interrogative pronoun or phrase from within an embedded clause in
        long-distance questions. This construction, however, also requires the polar question particle <or>za</or> in
        the matrix clause.

      <h3>Subordination and relative clauses</h3>

      <p>
        Independent clauses are transformed into dependent clauses via raising of the <kbd>Pol</kbd> constituent to the
        head of the complement phrase, allowing embedding of clauses and construction of relative clauses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once a clause has been transformed into a dependent clause it can simply be used as an argument in an
        independent clause.
      </p>

      <p>
        As in <a href="#coordination">coordination</a>, there is a volitional pivot, allowing the noun phrase with the
        highest agency to be omitted in the embedded clause if it is shared with the matrix clause.

      <div class="center descendant-suggestion">
        <p>
          In practice, only one of the polarity markers is likely to be phonetically overt at any given time and,
          since they are adjacent, whichever one it is is indeterminate. This could result in merging of the two
          polarity markers, effectively transforming the clause into a normal independent clause with no subordinate.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subordination transformation renders a correct independent clause structure for both transitive and
          intransitive subordinates. This lends itself to reinterpretation as a serial verb construction in daughters.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Relative clauses use the same subordination structure with the head of the relative clause being extracted to
        the matrix clause and replaced in the relative clause with the appropriate pronoun. As with adjectives,
        relative clauses precede the nouns they modify.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic permits only core arguments of the relative clause to act as its head, restricting the role of
        the head in the relative clause to either the subject, object, or indirect object. Because of this restriction,

      <h3>Coordination</h3>

      <p>
        Proto-Tiengic has a large set of coordinators that specify the relationship between the coordinated
        constituents. A list of these coordinators is givev in the appendices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps the simplest of these coordinators is <or>zde</or>, corresponding to English 'and'.
      </p>

      <translation>
        <gloss>
          mʲe bʷir-yi-k zde mʲe la-ya-tʲ
          1S mother&lt;CNS&gt; and 1S father&lt;CNS&gt;
        </gloss>
        <trans>My mother and my father.</trans>
      </translation>

      <p>
        Where the two constituents of the coordination are clauses, Proto-Tiengic allows omission of the argument of
        the highest volition in the second clause if it is shared between the clauses.
