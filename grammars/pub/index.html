      <h1>Proto-Upper-Borosan</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>
        Proto-Upper-Borosan is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of the Upper-Borosan languages. It
        should be noted that the Upper-Borosan languages do not include every language spoken in upper Boroso, and
        there are Upper-Borosan languages spoken in southern Boroso.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most reconstructions estimate Proto-Upper-Borosan was spoken by a unified group of people around approximately
        4000 BCE, although estimates may vary by up to a thousand years. Genetic analyses and limited archaeological
        evidence suggest that the original homeland of speakers of Proto-Upper-Borosan was somewhere around the
        southern and eastern shores of Lake Qëërles.

        Voiced stops and nasal consonants are in complementary distribution, with the nasals occurring adjacent to
        nasal vowels and voiced stops occurring elsewhere. This is not distinguished orthographically as where they
        occur as nasals can be recovered from the environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following orthography will be adopted for ease of typing. Unless noted below, phonemes are written as their
        IPA.

      <p>
        Proto-Upper-Borosan permits geminate stops and nasals medially. Phonemically this is analysed as having an
        intervening syllable break, but is realised as a geminate in the onset of the second syllable.
      </p>

      <h3>Syllable structure</h3>

      <p>
        <kbd>(C)(L)V(j)(C)</kbd>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><kbd>L</kbd> is one of /l r j w/
        <li>in complex onsets (i.e. <kbd>CL</kbd>) <kbd>C</kbd> cannot be in <kbd>L</kbd>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any diphthongs are prohibited; if two vowels come into contact, an intervening glottal stop is inserted.
      </p>

      <h3>Stress</h3>

      <p>
        Stress placement is irregular and words can contrast only in position of stress. Stress is realised as a slight
        raise in pitch, relative to the surrounding syllables. It is written with an acute accent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vowels /a ã u ũ/ reduce in unstressed syllables, merging to [ə ə̃]. This is not indicated
        orthographically. Where these vowels occur in positions that will never be stressed, i.e. never realised as
        anything other than [ə ə̃] and the "original" phoneme cannot be recovered, <or>a</or> is used as a default.
      </p>

      <h2>Morphology</h2>
      <h3>Nouns and noun phrases</h3>

      <p>
        Nouns inflect for two numbers, singular and plural, and two cases, direct and oblique. The direct case notes
        nouns with a special relation to the verb, typically that of the agent or patient. This relationship is
        indicated with "trigger" markers on the verb stem (see <a href="#triggers"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important to note the distinction between the oblique case and oblique arguments in the sentence. The
        oblique case here is the unmarked form of nouns and is used for nouns that do not have the relation to the verb
        indicated by the direct case. In any given clause typically only a single argument is marked in the direct
        case, with all others being in the unmarked "oblique" case, resulting in core arguments (the subject and
        object) frequently appearing in the oblique case despite being core arguments. Thus it should be noted that the
        oblique case does not mark oblique arguments, which are distinguishable through word order and other verbal
        markings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The noun's inflectional paradigm is given below.

        and <or>i</or> in the third person. These basic stems are taken to be in the oblique case and can inflect as
        any other nouns to form the full pronominal paradigm, given below.

      <h3>Verbs and verb phrases</h3>
      <h4>Verb classes</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Upper-Borosan verbs are sorted into a number of semantic classes based off of their argument structure -
        the number and theta roles of the arguments they take. Most of these classes are open and membership of a
        particular form is determined semantically, however each verb is part of only a single class and there are no
        productive methods for changing a verb's classification.
      </p>

        The classes of verbs and their argument structure properties are given in the table below.

      <h4>Triggers</h4>

      <p>
        Verbs take trigger suffixes that mark the role of the argument in the direct case. There are four suffixes,
        marking core agent and patient arguments, and locative and benefactive obliques. This serves to focus certain
        arguments, the noun in the direct case being focused, having its role and semantics highlighted in contrast to
        the backing of arguments whose roles are indicated only by syntactic means.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agentive trigger indicates that the argument in the direct case is an agent or volitional in the action.
        This is marked by reduplicating the final consonant, or suffixing <or>-y</or> on vowel-final words, and
        suffixing <or>-ą</or>.

      <p>
        The patientive marker indicates that the argument in the direct case is a patient or involitional in the
        action. It is marked with the suffix <or>-ąró</or> after reduplication of the final consonant, or suffixing <or>-y</or>
        on vowel final words. It has allomorphs <or>-Cązi</or> on polysyllabic words ending in <kbd>CV</kbd> where <kbd>C</kbd>
        is a fricative or /ʔ/ with deletion of the final syllable, and <or>-Cala</or> on iambs (disyllabic words where
        the second syllable is stressed).

      <!-- <h4>Tense and aspect</h4>

      <p>
        There is a set of tense and aspect particles that are positioned sentence finally and mark the tense or aspect
        of the phrase. Only one of these particles can occur at a time.
      </p>

      <h4>Negation</h4>

      <p>
        Negation in Proto-Upper-Borosan is achieved with a simple postverbal particle, <orth>ye</orth>.
      </p>

      <h4>Applicatives</h4>

      <p>
        Proto-Upper-Borosan displays three primary applicative markers that it uses to promote oblique arguments to
        core argument positions, turning intransitives into transitives and transitives into ditransitives. Each
        applicative has differing use cases, giving the promoted argument differing semantics, and interacts with the
        verb classes differently. The applied object is typically inserted before the original object, sometimes with
        the original object being elided. There is however, no overt marking distinguishing the original and applied
        objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary purpose of the applicatives is to promote especially salient or relevant arguments to a more
        prominent position in the sentence. For this reason the applicative is preferred for particularly animate
        obliques, with first and second person obliques almost always being promoted by means of an applicative.
      </p>

      <p>
        The directive applicative, indicated by the suffix <or>-lą’</or>, typically introduces arguments indicating the
        goal of an action, the location where it happened, or an instrument with which the action was accomplished.
      </p>

        <trans>I am cooking in the house.</trans>
      </translation>

      <p>
        The relational applicative, indicated by the suffix <or>-hur</or>, introduces arguments that are benefactors or
        malefactors of the action, a stimulus of a psychological or perceptual event, abstract goals of an action, or
        goal of a speech act.

      </translation>

      <p>
        The benefactive applicative, indicated by the suffix <or>-Caj</or>, introduces arguments that are benefactors
        of an action, typically more directly than the relational applicative such as commands, malefactors of an
        action, or the goal or source of an adverse event.

      <h3>Adjectives</h3>

      <p>
        In Proto-Upper-Borosan, "true" adjectives form a small, closed class with no productive derivation methods. The
        most common adjectival forms are null derivations from verbs, forming participle-like meanings. The distinction
        between true adjectives and other adjectival forms is an important one, with only true adjectives being
        reasonably considerable as a distinct part of speech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adjectives follow the phrases they modify. Most modifying things like adpositions are adjectives
        in PUB, and most nouns and verbs can either directly act as adjectives or be derived into one.
      </p>

        In predicative phrases, adjective stems can be used as verbs.

      </translation>

      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <h3>Primary word order</h3>

      <p>
        Proto-Upper-Borosan displays a primary <kbd>VSO</kbd> word order, however as the roles of arguments can be
        explicitly indicated, variation in this is permitted for pragmatic effect.
      </p>

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <h4>Polar questions</h4>

      <p>
        Polar questions are made by moving the verb to the sentence final position and leaving the particle <or>i</or>
        as a trace.
      </p>

      </translation>

      <h4>Content questions</h4>

      <p>
        Content questions are made with <or>mąr</or> 'who, what'. This inflects like any other noun but is fronted
        to the start of the sentence, bringing any modifiers with it. This structure covers 'who, what, where, why,
        how' by using the agentive/patientive, agentive/patientive, locative, benefactive, and instrumental triggers
        respectively.
      </p>

      </translation>

      <p>
        For 'when' questions, <or>mą́si</or> 'when' is simply placed in the sentence initial position.
      </p>

      <h3>Causative constructions</h3>

      <p>
        Causative constructions are made with the verb <or>dó&rsquo;e</or> 'to make, to cause to come about'. The main
        verb is replaced with <or>dó&rsquo;e</or> and the verb phrase being transformed is moved to the position after
        the patient.
      </p>

      <div class="indent transformation">
        <p><kbd>V S O </kbd> ⟶ <kbd> dó&rsquo;e S O V</kbd><br>

      </translation>

      <h3>Subordination</h3>

      <p>
        Subordination is achieved by adjectivisation of the clause being subordinated. This is done by placing the
        unmarked form of the main verb of the subordinated phrase at the phrase initial position, before the marked
        form.
      </p>

      </translation>

      <h4>Relative clauses</h4>

      <p>
        Relative clauses are formed as subordinated phrases treated as adjectives, following the nouns they modify.
        They
        are correlative, requiring that the phrase being subordinated contains the head noun phrase in the direct case,
        and they leave a pronoun in the place of the head noun phrase in the main clause.
      </p>

      <div class="indent transformation">
        <p><kbd>V S<sub>i</sub><sup>DIR</sup> O<sub>j</sub> </kbd> ⟶
          <kbd> Pro<sub>i</sub> V S<sub>i</sub><sup>DIR</sup> O<sub>j</sub></kbd><br>

      </translation>

      <h3>Coordination</h3>
      <h4>Of noun phrases</h4>

      <p>
        Coordination is done with the coordinating verb <or>tha</or>. This verb subordinates the second element of
        the coordination to the first.
      </p>

      <div class="indent transformation">
        <p><kbd>N<sub>i</sub> N<sub>j</sub> </kbd> ⟶ <kbd> N<sub>i</sub> tha N<sub>j</sub><sup>DIR</sup></kbd></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The verb usually takes the agentive trigger, but which trigger is used can indicate the case of individual
        elements in the coordination when it is used. Whether the first element is direct or oblique is the case of the
        coordination as a whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ref>patientive_coordination</ref> uses the patientive trigger since the speaker, the second element in the
        coordination, is the nonvolitional patient of the action.
      </p>

      <h4>Of matrix clauses</h4>

        A number of conjunctions are used to indicate the relationship between conjoined matrix clauses.
